Talk abstract and description can be consulted [here](./ABSTRACT_EN.md) (EN).

Slides can be consulted online. There are two versions:
* ["live"](https://nrinaudo.github.io/optics-from-the-ground-up/) (the ones I use when giving a talk)
* [annotated](https://nrinaudo.github.io/optics-from-the-ground-up/annotated.html) (hopefully mostly understandable without me to explain)

You can also view recordings of this talk:
* at the [Paris Scala User Group](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=553LqpTmeRE) (FR).
