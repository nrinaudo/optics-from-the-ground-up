Optics are a part of FP that has long frightened me - it sounds so intellectual and hard and out of reach!

Turns out though, once you actually sit down and study them, optics are surprisingly simple.

The purpose of this talk is not to make anyone an optics expert, but to demystify them and show people that they're as useful as they're easy to grasp.

Attendants would ideally be able to read idiomatic Scala code and know what an ADT is.

Slides can be consulted directly on the [companion site](https://nrinaudo.github.io/optics-from-the-ground-up/).

You can also view a recording of this talk at the [Paris Scala User Group](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=553LqpTmeRE) (FR).
