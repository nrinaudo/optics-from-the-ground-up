# Talk Abstract

Optics are a powerful tool to have at one’s disposal, but have a reputation for being arcane and hard to grasp.

The purpose of this talk is to show that they’re neither and that the vast majority of use cases are covered by a few oddly named but simple concepts

# Talk Description

Optics are a part of FP that have long frightened me - they sound so intellectual and hard and out of reach!

Turns out though, once you actually sit down and study them, optics are surprisingly simple.

The purpose of this talk is not to make anyone an optics expert, but to demystify them and show people that they’re as useful as they’re easy to grasp.

Attendants would ideally be able to read idiomatic Scala code and know what an ADT is.

# Misc.

While I’m not the world’s leading expert on optics by any measure, I do have an interesting perspective on them - they scared me witless for years, and I just refused to learn them because they sounded so out of reach. Having eventually learned them (due a combination of insomnia and screaming toddlers), I’m quite keen on helping others get over their fear of the intimidating vocabulary (lenses! prisms! profunctors!) and reaping the benefits of this powerful construct.

At the end of the talk, attendants should:

* understand the core concepts of optics (at least the ones that don’t require CT abstractions)
* know which libraries are available for them to get started immediately
* have seen a few concrete use cases, one of which does not involve ADT traversal, and be raring to start using them in their own code
